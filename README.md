# Outlook-Macros
VBA Macros to be used in conjunction with Outlook. I'm not going to go into detail here on how you enable and use macros in Outlook, I have  ablog post here: https://works4me.info/enabling-macros-in-outlook/ which goes over that. These are just working examples of what you can do. Just copy paste and edit them to match your needs.

## Word Replacement
This is a simple one, and it goes through the fictitious scenario in which someone has clicked the "buy me a coffee" link on my blog, and I'm using this to say thanks... automated this way because I'm doing it so much.

Keep in mind, it opens a oft template, whihc can have pictures, and attachments, and you can do maths in you vba to put in the date and make references. 

This is just an super simply solution, open the oft, asks for certian words, then replace **targeted** words with what you've uploaded
